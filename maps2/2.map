#there might be a very big problem with this map
#due to the way we implement BFS, it's impossible for our algo to indentify
#the route of 0<6<5<2<1 as valid
#we might need to find a new algo, or adapt the current one
#so that it can handle this case as well
#for now, there are 2 ends appearing on edge list
#but we can possibly trace back to only 1 path
#we still need to find a way to adjust
